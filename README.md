## Contribute to the project
This application is available on my github, it must be clone with command line 
"git clone https://github.com/Sab-Ben/Poc-chat.git".
When the project is cloned, use file script.sql available via 
Poc-chat/chat-websocket-backend/src/main/resources/script.sql


To install MySQL :

If you have Docker, create an image with the following command line "docker pull mysql" to get the latest one.
The MySQL image requires that you supply a root password. You cannot set this in the Docker Desktop GUI and must do so through the command line (PowerShell or cmd):
docker run --name my-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword -d mysql. A terminal window should appear. First run mysql -u root -p and enter your specified root password when prompted.
Once you reach the MySQL prompt,then retrieve the information from the script.sql 
file and copy and paste it into the terminal window.

Otherwise with MySQL Workbench : Import the sql script from 
Developpez-une-application-full-stack-complete/src/main/resources/script.sql 
and execute it, this will create the tables
From MySQL terminal: Use the command SOURCE </absolute/path/to/script>
